# ebpf_exporter

Prometheus exporter for custom eBPF metrics and OpenTelemetry traces.

* Metrics:

![metrics](./examples/biolatency.png)

* [Traces](./tracing):

![tracing](./examples/exec-trace.png)

Motivation of this exporter is to allow you to write eBPF code and export
metrics that are not otherwise accessible from the Linux kernel.

[ebpf.io](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/) describes eBPF:

> eBPF is a revolutionary technology with origins in the Linux kernel that can
> run sandboxed programs in a privileged context such as the operating system
> kernel. It is used to safely and efficiently extend the capabilities of the
> kernel without requiring to change kernel source code or load kernel modules.

An easy way of thinking about this exporter is bcc tools as prometheus metrics:

* https://iovisor.github.io/bcc

We use libbpf rather than legacy bcc driven code, so it's more like libbpf-tools:

* https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/libbpf-tools

Producing [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) compatible traces is also
supported, see [Tracing docs](./tracing/) for more information on that.

## Building and running

### Actual building

To build a binary, clone the repo and run:

```
make build
```

The default `build` target makes a static binary, but you could also
use the `build-dynamic` target if you'd like a dynamically linked binary.
In either case `libbpf` is built from source, but you could override this
behavior with `BUILD_LIBBPF=0`, if you want to use your system `libbpf`.

If you're having trouble building on the host, you can try building in Docker:

```
docker build --tag ebpf_exporter --target ebpf_exporter .
docker cp $(docker create ebpf_exporter):/ebpf_exporter ./
```

To build examples (see [building examples section](#building-examples)):

```
make -C examples clean build
```

To run with [`biolatency`](examples/biolatency.yaml) config:

```
sudo ./ebpf_exporter --config.dir=examples --config.names=biolatency
```

If you pass `--debug`, you can see raw maps at `/maps` endpoint
and see debug output from `libbpf` itself.

### Docker image

A docker image can be built from this repo. A prebuilt image with examples
included is also available for download from GitHub Container Registry:

* https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter/pkgs/container/ebpf_exporter

To build the image with just the exporter binary, run the following:

```
docker build --tag ebpf_exporter --target ebpf_exporter .
```

To run it with the examples, you need to build them first (see above).
Then you can run by running a privileged container and bind-mounting:

* `$(pwd)/examples:/examples:ro` to allow access to examples on the host
* `/sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro` to allow resolving cgroups

You might have to bind-mount additional directories depending on your needs.
You might also not need to bind-mount anything for simple kprobe examples.

The actual command to run the docker container (from the repo directory):

```
docker run --rm -it --privileged -p 9435:9435 \
  -v $(pwd)/examples:/examples \
  -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
  ebpf_exporter --config.dir=examples --config.names=timers
```

For production use you would either bind-mount your own config and compiled
bpf programs corresponding to it, or build your own image based on ours
with your own config baked in.

For development use when you don't want or have any dev tools on the host,
you can build the docker image with examples bundled:

```
docker build --tag ebpf_exporter --target ebpf_exporter_with_examples .
```

Some examples then can run without any bind mounts:

```
docker run --rm -it --privileged -p 9435:9435 \
  ebpf_exporter --config.dir=examples --config.names=timers
```

Or with the publicly available prebuilt image:

```
docker run --rm -it --privileged -p 9435:9435 \
  ghcr.io/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter --config.dir=examples --config.names=timers
```

## Kubernetes Helm chart

A third party helm chart is available here:

* https://github.com/kubeservice-stack/kubservice-charts/tree/master/charts/kubeservice-ebpf-exporter

Please note that the helm chart is not provided or supported by Cloudflare,
so do your own due diligence and use it at your own risk.

## Benchmarking overhead

See [benchmark](benchmark) directory to get an idea of how low ebpf overhead is.

## Required capabilities

While you can run `ebpf_exporter` as `root`, it is not strictly necessary.
Only the following two capabilities are necessary for normal operation:

* `CAP_BPF`: required for privileged bpf operations and for reading memory
* `CAP_PERFMON`: required to attach bpf programs to kprobes and tracepoints

If you are using `systemd`, you can use the following configuration to run
as on otherwise unprivileged dynamic user with the needed capabilities:

```ini
DynamicUser=true
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_BPF CAP_PERFMON
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_BPF CAP_PERFMON
```

Prior to Linux v5.8 there was no dedicated `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON`,
but you can use `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` instead of your kernel is older.

If you pass `--capabilities.keep=none` flag to `ebpf_expoter`, then it drops
all capabilities after attaching the probes, leaving it fully unprivileged.

The following additional capabilities might be needed:

* `CAP_SYSLOG`: if you use `ksym` decoder to have access to `/proc/kallsyms`.
  Note that you must keep this capability: `--capabilities.keep=cap_syslog`.
  See: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4/source/kernel/kallsyms.c#L982
* `CAP_IPC_LOCK`: if you use `perf_event_array` for reading from the kernel.
  Note that you must keep it: `--capabilities.keep=cap_perfmon,cap_ipc_lock`.
* `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`: if you want BTF information from modules.
  See: https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/v1.2.0/src/libbpf.c#L8654-L8666
  and https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5-rc1/source/kernel/bpf/syscall.c#L3789
* `CAP_NET_ADMIN`: if you use net admin related programs like xdp.
  See: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4/source/kernel/bpf/syscall.c#L3787
* `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`: if you run an older kernel without memcg accounting for
  bpf memory. Upstream Linux kernel added support for this in v5.11.
  See: https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/v1.2.0/src/bpf.c#L98-L106
* `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`: if you want to use `fanotify` to monitor cgroup changes,
  which is the preferred way, but only available since Linux v6.6.
  See: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0ce7c12e88cf

## External BTF Support

Execution of eBPF programs requires kernel data types normally available
in `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`, which is created during kernel build process.
However, on some older kernel configurations, this file might not be available.
If that's the case, an external BTF file can be supplied with `--btf.path`.
An archive of BTFs for all some older distros and kernel versions can be
found [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub-archive).

## Supported scenarios

Currently the only supported way of getting data out of the kernel is via maps.

See [examples](#examples) section for real world examples.

If you have examples you want to share, please feel free to open a PR.

## Configuration

Skip to [format](#configuration-file-format) to see the full specification.

### Examples

You can find additional examples in [examples](examples) directory.

Unless otherwise specified, all examples are expected to work on Linux 5.15,
which is the latest LTS release at the time of writing. Thanks to CO-RE,
examples are also supposed to work on any modern kernel with BTF enabled.

You can find the list of supported distros in `libbpf` README:

* https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf#bpf-co-re-compile-once--run-everywhere

#### Building examples

To build examples, run:

```
make -C examples clean build
```

This will use `clang` to build examples with `vmlinux.h` we provide
in this repo (see [include](include/README.md) for more on `vmlinux.h`).

Examples need to be compiled before they can be used.

Note that compiled examples can be used as is on any BTF enabled kernel
with no runtime dependencies. Most modern Linux distributions have it enabled.

#### Timers via tracepoints (counters)

This config attaches to kernel tracepoints for timers subsystem
and counts timers that fire with breakdown by timer name.

Resulting metrics:

```
# HELP ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total Timers fired in the kernel
# TYPE ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total counter
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="blk_stat_timer_fn"} 10
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="commit_timeout	[jbd2]"} 1
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="delayed_work_timer_fn"} 25
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="dev_watchdog"} 1
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="mix_interrupt_randomness"} 3
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="neigh_timer_handler"} 1
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="process_timeout"} 49
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="reqsk_timer_handler"} 2
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="tcp_delack_timer"} 5
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="tcp_keepalive_timer"} 6
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="tcp_orphan_update"} 16
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="tcp_write_timer"} 12
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="tw_timer_handler"} 1
ebpf_exporter_timer_starts_total{function="writeout_period"} 5
```

There's config file for it:

```yaml
metrics:
  counters:
    - name: timer_starts_total
      help: Timers fired in the kernel
      labels:
        - name: function
          size: 8
          decoders:
            - name: ksym
```

And corresponding C code that compiles into an ELF file with eBPF bytecode:

```C
#include <vmlinux.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_tracing.h>
#include "maps.bpf.h"

struct {
    __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH);
    __uint(max_entries, 1024);
    __type(key, u64);
    __type(value, u64);
} timer_starts_total SEC(".maps");

SEC("tp_btf/timer_start")
int BPF_PROG(timer_start, struct timer_list *timer)
{
    u64 function = (u64) timer->function;
    increment_map(&timer_starts_total, &function, 1);
    return 0;
}

char LICENSE[] SEC("license") = "GPL";
```

#### Block IO histograms (histograms)

This config attaches to block io subsystem and reports disk latency
as a prometheus histogram, allowing you to compute percentiles.

The following tools are working with similar concepts:

* https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/biosnoop_example.txt
* https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/biolatency_example.txt
* https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/bitesize_example.txt

This program was the initial reason for the exporter and was heavily
influenced by the experimental exporter from Daniel Swarbrick:

* https://github.com/dswarbrick/ebpf_exporter

You can nicely plot this with Grafana:

## Configuration concepts

The following concepts exists within `ebpf_exporter`.

### Configs

Configs describe how to extract metrics from kernel. Each config has
a corresponding eBPF code that runs in kernel to produce these metrics.

Multiple configs can be loaded at the same time.

### Metrics

Metrics define what values we get from eBPF program running in the kernel.

#### Counters

Counters from maps are direct transformations: you pull data out of kernel,
transform map keys into sets of labels and export them as prometheus counters.

#### Histograms

Histograms from maps are a bit more complex than counters. Maps in the kernel
cannot be nested, so we need to pack keys in the kernel and unpack in user space.

We get from this:

```
sda, read, 1ms -> 10 ops
sda, read, 2ms -> 25 ops
sda, read, 4ms -> 51 ops
```

To this:

```
sda, read -> [1ms -> 10 ops, 2ms -> 25 ops, 4ms -> 51 ops]
```

Prometheus histograms expect to have all buckets when we report a metric,
but the kernel creates keys as events occur, which means we need to backfill
the missing data.

That's why for histogram configuration we have the following keys:

* `bucket_type`: can be either `exp2`, `exp2zero`, `linear`, or `fixed`
* `bucket_min`: minimum bucket key (`exp2`, `exp2zero` and `linear` only)
* `bucket_max`: maximum bucket key (`exp2`, `exp2zero` and `linear` only)
* `bucket_keys`: maximum bucket key (`fixed` only)
* `bucket_multiplier`: multiplier for bucket keys (default is `1`)

##### `exp2` histograms

For `exp2` histograms we expect kernel to provide a map with linear keys that
are log2 of actual values. We then go from `bucket_min` to `bucket_max` in
user space and remap keys by exponentiating them:

```
count = 0
for i = bucket_min; i < bucket_max; i++ {
  count += map.get(i, 0)
  result[exp2(i) * bucket_multiplier] = count
}
```

Here `map` is the map from the kernel and `result` is what goes to prometheus.

Use `increment_exp2_histogram` in ebpf to observe values.

##### `exp2zero` histograms

These are the same as `exp2` histograms, except:

* The first key is for the value `0`
* All other keys are `1` larger than they should be

Use `increment_exp2zero_histogram` in ebpf to observe values.

##### `linear` histograms

For `linear` histograms we expect kernel to provide a map with linear keys
that are results of integer division of original value by `bucket_multiplier`.
To reconstruct the histogram in user space we do the following:

```
count = 0
for i = bucket_min; i < bucket_max; i++ {
  count += map.get(i, 0)
  result[i * bucket_multiplier] = count
}
```

##### `fixed` histograms

For `fixed` histograms we expect kernel to provide a map with fixed keys
defined by the user.

```
count = 0
for i = 0; i < len(bucket_keys); i++ {
  count  += map.get(bucket_keys[i], 0)
  result[bucket_keys[i] * multiplier] = count
}
```

##### `sum` keys

For `exp2` and `linear` histograms, if `bucket_max + 1` contains a non-zero
value, it will be used as the `sum` key in histogram, providing additional
information and allowing richer metrics.

For `fixed` histograms, if `buckets_keys[len(bucket_keys) - 1 ] + 1` contains
a non-zero value, it will be used as the `sum` key.

### Labels

Labels transform kernel map keys into prometheus labels.

Maps coming from the kernel are binary encoded. Values are always `u64`, but
keys can be either primitive types like `u64` or complex `struct`s.

Each label can be transformed with decoders (see below) according to metric
configuration. Generally the number of labels matches the number of elements
in the kernel map key.

For map keys that are represented as `struct`s alignment rules apply:

* `u64` must be aligned at 8 byte boundary
* `u32` must be aligned at 4 byte boundary
* `u16` must be aligned at 2 byte boundary

This means that the following struct:

```c
struct disk_latency_key_t {
    u32 dev;
    u8 op;
    u64 slot;
};
```

Is represented as:

* 4 byte `dev` integer
* 1 byte `op` integer
* 3 byte padding to align `slot`
* 8 byte `slot` integer

When decoding, either specify the padding explicitly with the key `padding` or
include it in the label size:

* 4 for `dev`
* 4 for `op` (1 byte value + 3 byte padding)
* 8 byte `slot`

### Decoders

Decoders take a byte slice input of requested length and transform it into
a byte slice representing a string. That byte slice can either be consumed
by another decoder (for example `string` -> `regexp`) or or used as the final
label value exporter to Prometheus.

Below are decoders we have built in.

#### `cgroup`

With cgroup decoder you can turn the u64 from `bpf_get_current_cgroup_id`
into a human readable string representing cgroup path, like:

* `/sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/ssh.service`

#### ifname

Ifname decoder takes a network interface index and converts it into its
name like `eth0`.

#### `dname`

Dname decoder read DNS qname from string in wire format, then decode
it into '.' notation format. Could be used after `string` decoder.
E.g.: `\x07example\03com\x00` will become `example.com`. This decoder
could be used after `string` decode, like the following example:

```yaml
- name: qname
  decoders:
    - name: string
    - name: dname
```

#### `errno`

Errno decoder converts `errno` number into a string representation like
`EPIPE`. It is normally paired with a `unit` decoder as the first step.

### `hex`

Hex decoder turns bytes into their hex representation.

#### `inet_ip`

Network IP decoded can turn byte encoded IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
that kernel operates on into human readable form like `1.1.1.1`.

#### `ksym`

KSym decoder takes kernel address and converts that to the function name.

In your eBPF program you can use `PT_REGS_IP_CORE(ctx)` to get the address
of the function you attached to as a `u64` variable. Note that for kprobes
you need to wrap it with `KPROBE_REGS_IP_FIX()` from `regs-ip.bpf.h`.

#### `majorminor`

With major-minor decoder you can turn kernel's combined u32 view
of major and minor device numbers into a device name in `/dev`.

### `pci_vendor`

With `pci_vendor` decoder you can transform PCI vendor IDs like 0x8086
into human readable vendor names like `Intel Corporation`.

### `pci_device`

With `pci_vendor` decoder you can transform PCI vendor IDs like 0x80861000
into human readable names like `82542 Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Fiber)`.

Note that the you need to concatenate vendor and device id together for this.

### `pci_class`

With `pci_class` decoder you can transform PCI class ID (the lowest byte) into
the class name like `Network controller`.

### `pci_subclass`

With `pci_subclass` decoder you can transform PCI subclass (two lowest bytes)
into the subclass name like `Ethernet controller`.

#### `regexp`

Regexp decoder takes list of strings from `regexp` configuration key
of the decoder and ties to use each as a pattern in `golang.org/pkg/regexp`:

* https://golang.org/pkg/regexp

If decoder input matches any of the patterns, it is permitted.
Otherwise, the whole metric label set is dropped.

An example to report metrics only for `systemd-journal` and `syslog-ng`:

```yaml
- name: command
  decoders:
    - name: string
    - name: regexp
      regexps:
        - ^(kswapd).*$ # if sub-matches are present, the first one is used for the value
        - ^systemd-journal$
        - ^syslog-ng$
```

#### `static_map`

Static map decoder takes input and maps it to another value via `static_map`
configuration key of the decoder. Values are expected as strings.

An example to match `1` to `read` and `2` to `write`:

```yaml
- name: operation
  decoders:
    - name:static_map
      static_map:
        1: read
        2: write
```
Unknown keys will be replaced by `"unknown:key_name"` unless `allow_unknown: true`
is specified in the decoder. For example, the above will decode `3` to `unknown:3`
and the below example will decode `3` to `3`:

```yaml
- name: operation
  decoders:
    - name:static_map
      allow_unknown: true
      static_map:
        1: read
        2: write
```


#### `string`

String decoder transforms possibly null terminated strings coming
from the kernel into string usable for prometheus metrics.

### `syscall`

Syscall decoder transforms syscall numbers into syscall names.

The tables can be regenerated by `make syscalls`. See `scripts/mksyscalls`.

#### `uint`

UInt decoder transforms hex encoded `uint` values from the kernel
into regular base10 numbers. For example: `0xe -> 14`.

## Per CPU map support

Per CPU map reading is fully supported. If the last decoder for a percpu
map is called `cpu` (use 2 byte `uint` decoder), then `cpu` label is
added automatically. If it's not present, then the percpu counters are
aggregated into one global counter.

There is [percpu-softirq](examples/percpu-softirq.bpf.c) in examples.
See #226 for examples of different modes of operation for it.

### Configuration file format

Configuration file is defined like this:

```
# Metrics attached to the program
[ metrics: metrics ]
# Kernel symbol addresses to define as kaddr_{symbol} from /proc/kallsyms (consider CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL)
kaddrs:
  [ - symbol_to_resolve ]
```

#### `metrics`

See [Metrics](#metrics) section for more details.

```
counters:
  [ - counter ]
histograms:
  [ - histogram ]
```

#### `counter`

See [Counters](#counters) section for more details.

```
name: <prometheus counter name>
help: <prometheus metric help>
perf_event_array: <whether map is a BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY map: bool>
flush_interval: <how often should we flush metrics from the perf_event_array: time.Duration>
labels:
  [ - label ]
[ values: { name: "...", help: "..."}]
```

An example of `perf_map` can be found [here](examples/oomkill.yaml).

An example of `values` can be found [here](examples/complex-value.yaml).

#### `histogram`

See [Histograms](#histograms) section for more details.

```
name: <prometheus histogram name>
help: <prometheus metric help>
bucket_type: <map bucket type: exp2 or linear>
bucket_multiplier: <map bucket multiplier: float64>
bucket_min: <min bucket value: int>
bucket_max: <max bucket value: int>
labels:
  [ - label ]
```

#### `label`

See [Labels](#labels) section for more details.

```
name: <prometheus label name>
size: <field size>
padding: <padding size>
decoders:
  [ - decoder ]
```

#### `decoder`

See [Decoders](#decoders) section for more details.

```
name: <decoder name>
# ... decoder specific configuration
```

## Built-in metrics

### `ebpf_exporter_enabled_configs`

This gauge reports a timeseries for every loaded config:

```
# HELP ebpf_exporter_enabled_configs The set of enabled configs
# TYPE ebpf_exporter_enabled_configs gauge
ebpf_exporter_enabled_configs{name="cachestat"} 1
```

### `ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_info`

This gauge reports information available for every ebpf program:

```
# HELP ebpf_exporter_ebpf_programs Info about ebpf programs
# TYPE ebpf_exporter_ebpf_programs gauge
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_info{config="cachestat",id="545",program="add_to_page_cache_lru",tag="6c007da3187b5b32"} 1
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_info{config="cachestat",id="546",program="mark_page_accessed",tag="6c007da3187b5b32"} 1
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_info{config="cachestat",id="547",program="folio_account_dirtied",tag="6c007da3187b5b32"} 1
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_info{config="cachestat",id="548",program="mark_buffer_dirty",tag="6c007da3187b5b32"} 1
```

Here `tag` can be used for tracing and performance analysis with two conditions:

* `net.core.bpf_jit_kallsyms=1` sysctl is set
* `--kallsyms=/proc/kallsyms` is passed to `perf record`

Newer kernels allow `--kallsyms` to `perf top` as well,
in the future it may not be required at all:

* https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1b3aae90c6abd

### `ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_attached`

This gauge reports whether individual programs were successfully attached.

```
# HELP ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_attached Whether a program is attached
# TYPE ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_attached gauge
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_attached{id="247"} 1
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_attached{id="248"} 1
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_attached{id="249"} 0
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_attached{id="250"} 1
```

It needs to be joined by `id` label with `ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_info`
to get more information about the program.

### `ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_time_seconds`

This counter reports how much time individual programs spent running.

```
# HELP ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_time_seconds How long has the program been executing
# TYPE ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_time_seconds counter
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_time_seconds{id="247"} 0
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_time_seconds{id="248"} 0.001252621
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_time_seconds{id="249"} 0
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_time_seconds{id="250"} 3.6668e-05
```

It requires `kernel.bpf_stats_enabled` sysctl to be enabled.

It needs to be joined by `id` label with `ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_info`
to get more information about the program.

### `ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_count_total`

This counter reports how many times individual programs ran.

```
# HELP ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_count_total How many times has the program been executed
# TYPE ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_count_total counter
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_count_total{id="247"} 0
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_count_total{id="248"} 11336
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_count_total{id="249"} 0
ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_run_count_total{id="250"} 69
```

It requires `kernel.bpf_stats_enabled` sysctl to be enabled.

It needs to be joined by `id` label with `ebpf_exporter_ebpf_program_info`
to get more information about the program.

### `ebpf_exporter_decoder_errors_total`

This counter reports the number of times labels failed to be decoded by config.

```
# HELP ebpf_exporter_decoder_errors_total How many times has decoders encountered errors
# TYPE ebpf_exporter_decoder_errors_total counter
ebpf_exporter_decoder_errors_total{config="kstack"} 0
ebpf_exporter_decoder_errors_total{config="sock-trace"} 4
```
